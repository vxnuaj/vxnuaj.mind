#### Insights:

- There's too much structure imposed from a young age that decreases agency.

- The lack of agency from a young age takes away the needed curiosity and exploration to build specific knowledge. Without specific knowledge, you can't provide unique insights or value. If applied in context, this becomes detrimental for the individual and the rest of society at scale.

- Obedience isn't good without a capacity for agency.

#### Highlights:

>**_Do children today have useful childhoods? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency-by-simon-sarris-18e7db5dd95#b4b33929-003b-42e1-95f6-7c01df6e3f85)_**

The way I see it, not all children aren't taken seriously.
They aren't given enough agency to explore on their own and rather made to align with what the parent says, modern schooling systems, and other expectations. 

Which isn't necessarily bad, but sometimes it's done too harshly. What you take away, the creativity, authentic development, and curiosity, is the loss. 

Some things you do have to teach, like basic manners, great communication, etc, but letting children dictate what they learn is how they become unique and learn to love to learn their own way.

>**_being in some kind of school (the “doing” is almost more “being told what to do”). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency-by-simon-sarris-18e7db5dd95#522855cc-6e85-4414-8300-7ab2b8424f38)_**

School has too much of a structure. It doesn't cultivate agency if you're just told what to do. 

From my experience, this seems to be the issue in high school.

And the more structure it has the less unique it can make a student. Hence, students are trained to have the same skills. And a high level of obedience.

I don't think obedience is good when you don't have the capacity for agency.

I don't think obedience is good when you don't think critically on why you're obeying something.

>**_Gaining agency is gaining the capacity to do something differently from, or in addition to, the events that simply happen to you. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency-by-simon-sarris-18e7db5dd95#8abc802a-f7b4-4aa1-a722-1678cdf74310)_**

>**_We seem to have a political (public) imagination so shallow that it cannot conceive of what to even _do_ with children, especially smart children. We fail to properly respect them all the way through adolescence, so we have engineered them to be useless in the interim. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency-by-simon-sarris-18e7db5dd95#37678715-bde0-4aea-b95d-8022a2c08231)_**

I notice, we're also preparing children and adolescents in younger years for careers in their 20s to 60s.

Then, most might only gain experience to provide the most value once their in the latter stage of their careers.

But Alexander the Great was conquering Kingdoms in his early 20s.

Why aren't we training children to be prepared to provide immense value from the get-go?

I think the ones who realize this and exit the default (gaining agency), are the ones who build something great.

EG: Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, etc. 

The rest are led down the funnel of a conventional career, which isn't bad, at least if it's a choice.

When you don't have the capacity to choose (agency) it and you're forced down it, then it becomes bad.

>**_Because of this shift, childhood contains the age where one can intuit very well how the world works while being prevented from acting upon it meaningfully. Instead of an adolescence full of rites of passage, where one attempts to master something and accept responsibility, we have made it full of waiting, and doing work—for school is work—that nearly everyone knows is fake. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency-by-simon-sarris-18e7db5dd95#a024030b-03a9-4173-a14b-81b624e9b6e9)_**

Essentially any meaning you can create at a young age becomes zilch as a school doesn't typically give you agency to be curious, creative, and authentic outside of its curriculum.

>**_Who could blame young adults for thinking that work is fake and meaningless if we prescribe fake and meaningless work for the first two decades of their existence? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency-by-simon-sarris-18e7db5dd95#de5770a1-068c-47af-84da-364e687e24b8)_**

When schools teach in a manner that seems fake and meaningless, a student begins to dislike learning and they associate it with work.

Some begin to dislike learning, reading, mathematics, and all wonderful bits of knowledge.

>**_they take on a learned helplessness, and downplay that the future is a reality at all. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency-by-simon-sarris-18e7db5dd95#338244f5-95fa-4155-bbe5-489fb6987e2c)_**

If a student can't see a future THEY can create, then their unique value might be gone.

Learned helplessness is detrimental, but I think everyone can cultivate agency with enough awareness and action.

>**_downplaying of agency in childhood not only creates fewer opportunities for great people, it must also create more marginal people. Ushering everyone into an endless default script is disastrous when underlying conditions or assumptions change. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency-by-simon-sarris-18e7db5dd95#dbf97dd8-a0e2-4c0a-9fb6-ef6fbe39e1ed)_**

For people who might have the capacity to be exceptional, being in a marginal system is non-conducive. It's urgent that they find their own path
