I'm going learn about philosophy and mindset. 
Leverage that knowledge to live life to the [[best]] I can.
Through implementation of a personal moral code.

**Very Wise.
Unique Perspective.
Great Understanding of Life.**
**Enlightened and Highly Aware.**

But quantifying it isn't the point. 
Internal growth is infinite, not finite. 

Therefore, always seek internal growth.
