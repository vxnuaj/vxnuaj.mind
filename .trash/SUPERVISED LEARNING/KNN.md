K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a [[machine learning]] algorithm, specifically, a [[supervised learning]] model that's used for [[classification]] and [[regression]] tasks.

The algorithm attempts to locate the nearest "neighbors", meaning data with the shortest distance from the input datapoint.

The KNN finds 'k' amount of neighbors and then compares the distance between the input data point to the 'k' piece(s) of data.

Then, it [classifies](obsidian://open?vault=VXNUAJ.VAULT&file=LIBRARY%2FTECH%2FARTIFICIAL%20INTELLIGENCE%2FMACHINE%20LEARNING%2FSUPERVISED%20LEARNING%2FClassification) the input data point into the class of data that's "nearest" or most closely related.
