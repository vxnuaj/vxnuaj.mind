Supervised learning uses pre-existing training data to teach [[machine learning]] models to yield the desired output.

It's called "supervised" as the model is trained on a labeled dataset intentionally selected to train the model for a specific purpose.

The training data includes correct and incorrect inputs which allows the model to learn over time from it's mistakes.
