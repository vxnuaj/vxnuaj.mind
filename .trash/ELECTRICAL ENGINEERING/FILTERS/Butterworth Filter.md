The Butterworth filter is a [[SIGNAL PROCESSING]] filter used for bandstop or bandpass. It's designed to have a frequency response as flat as possible in the passband or bandstop, meaning it's minimally affected by [[Phase Distortion]].

When approaching bandstop and bandpass thresholds, the Butterworth filter filters out frequency bands by uniformly attenuating them.

Even with a high filter order, the Butterworth filter mitigates [[Phase Distortion]] and attempts to uniformly attenuate signals with a steep roll-off.
