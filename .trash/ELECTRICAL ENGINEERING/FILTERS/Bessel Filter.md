The Bessel Filter is a [[SIGNAL PROCESSING]] filter designed to provide for uniform linear change amongst frequency bands in the bandstop or bandpass during [[SIGNAL PROCESSING]]. This allows for the maintenance of signal fidelity and mitigates [[Phase Distortion]].

The Bessel Filter is primarily used for the bandpass rather than the bandstop. 
This is because it's critical for the bandpass to be uniform and linear in order to preserve signal fidelity which is what the Bessel Filter provides for. 

This linearity isn't as critical in the bandstop as we don't aim to preserve data at the bandstop but rather to filter it out with a steep roll off to avoid excess signal noise.
