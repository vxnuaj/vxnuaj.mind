The basis for all Deep Learning, built to process data in a way that's analogous to the human brain.

Consists of an input layer responsible for taken in input data, hidden layer(s) responsible for computing data learning through [[weighted matrix]] and [[biases]], and a final output layer which outputs the computation of the network whether it be a [[classification]], [[regression]], [[clustering]], etc.
