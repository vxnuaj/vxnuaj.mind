Neural Networks are the basis for all Deep Learning, built to process data in a way that's analogous to the human brain.

It consists of an input layer responsible for taken in input data, hidden layer(s) responsible for computing data learning through a [[weighted matrix]] and [[biases]], and a final output layer, all consisting of multiple neurons. 

The output layer which outputs the computation of the network whether it be a [[classification]], [[regression]], [[clustering]], etc.
