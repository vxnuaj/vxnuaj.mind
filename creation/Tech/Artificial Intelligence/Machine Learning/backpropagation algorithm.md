A backpropagation algorithm is used to minimize the output of the [[loss function ]]through adjusting the [[weight]]s and [[bias]]es of a given [[neural network]] in order to increase the accuracy of the [[neural network]].

The backpropagation algorithm calculates the gradients of the [[loss function]] in respect to the weight and bias in the [[neural network]], which is then used to update the [[weight]]s and [[bias]]es through[[ optimization algorithms]].
