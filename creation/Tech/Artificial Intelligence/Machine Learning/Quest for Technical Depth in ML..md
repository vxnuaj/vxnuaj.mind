#### Building and Understanding a [[Neural Network for MNIST]] dataset, from scratch using only NumPy

**Summary:**  The original plan of this project was to get ahold of NumPy to learn how to use it more effectively and efficiently, in order to then get into ML. Little did I know that this'd lead me to a rabbit hole straight into [[neural network]]s, allowing me to directly learn their underlying functions from the get go.

**Takeaways:**

**Outcomes and Learnings**:
