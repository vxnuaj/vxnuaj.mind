Neural Networks are the basis for all Deep Learning, built to process data in a way that's analogous to the human brain.

All layers are made up of neurons which hold different trainable [[weights]] which allow it to learn over multiple iterations

The layers consist of an input layer responsible for taken in input data, hidden layer(s) responsible for computing data, learning through [[weighted matrix]], [[bias]], [[activation function]]s, and a final output layer which outputs the computation of a network whether it be [[classification]], [[regression]], [[clustering]], etc
