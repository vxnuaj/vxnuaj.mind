Unless specified otherwise, these are the defined variables that will be used in this database.

- $L$ is the total number of layers in a network
- $l$ is defined as the index of a specific layer, ranging from $1≤l≤L$
- $N$ is the total number of neurons at $l$ layer.
- $i$ is the index of a specific neuron at $l$ layer, ranging from $1≤i≤N$
- $j$ is the index of a specific neuron at layer $l-1$
- $a_j$ is the weighted sum of a neuron $j$ at previous layer $l-1$
- $a_i$ is the weighted sum of a neuron $i$ at layer $l$
- $z_{j}$ is the weighted sum of a neuron $j$ at previous layer $l-1$
- $z_{ji}$ is the weighted sum of a neuron $i$ at layer $l$
- $k$ is the index of $kth$ class of a dataset
- $K$ is the total number of classes in a dataset
